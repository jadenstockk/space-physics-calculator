# ðŸš€ Just a Random Space Physics Calculator

For my I.T. 10th grade pratical assessment task, I went with a "Space Physics Calculator". This is the first somewhat substantial Java project I have ever worked on. I was very happy to recieve 100%.

Note: the equations probably don't produce accurate results (especially the more advanced ones)

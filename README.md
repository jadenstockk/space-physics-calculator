# ðŸš€ Just a Random Space Physics Calculator

### For my I.T. 10th grade pratical assessment task, I went with a "Space Physics Calculator". I was very happy to recieve 100% after working hard to perfect the UI aspect

Note: the equations probably don't produce accurate results (especially the more advanced ones)
